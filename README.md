# Available documentation

-   [Standards and Methods](./Standards_Methods): a directory with three
    important documents:

    -   `ONDRI_Curation_Glossary.pdf` which is a glossary containing
        routinely used terms and acronyms with their definitions

    -   `ONDRI_Data_Standards.pdf` which is a document that outlines the
        data standards for all ONDRI data (at this time: OND01, OND05,
        OND06, and OND08 projects); this includes information on
        formatting, file and folder structures, naming conventions,
        missing codes, site codes, and many other critical pieces of
        information for data standards and curation.

    -   `ONDRI_NIBS_Methods.pdf` which provides a short and long
        description of the methods by the NIBS group. Generally this
        covers the multivariate outlier procedures we use as part of the
        NIBS pipeline.

-   [Apps](./Apps): Documentation for the apps and packages available in
    the [ondri-nibs](https://github.com/ondri-nibs) repository.

-   [Development](./Development): Internal and external documentation
    that discusses software development and bug reporting.
